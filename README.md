## What This Is

A production-grade AI Traffic Command Center with 10 interactive screens:

| Screen | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Command Center | Live city risk map, active events, KPIs, bimodal heatmap |
| Event Intelligence | AI impact forecaster, model comparison, SHAP feature importance |
| Resource Planner | Integer Programming officer deployment, barricade optimization |
| Diversion Engine | AI-ranked alternate routes, traffic redistribution analysis |
| Digital Twin | Animated before/after simulation across 4 scenario types |
| AI Copilot | Conversational command interface grounded on real ASTRAM data |
| AI War Room | One-click full deployment plan generator with timeline + cost savings |
| Model Accuracy | Honest CV metrics, leakage disclosure, data gap analysis |
| Alert Feed | Live severity-tiered alerts with SLA breach escalation |
| Post-Event Learning | MLflow self-learning loop, prediction vs actual, systemic learnings |

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum version | Check |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Node.js | 18.x or higher | `node -v` |
| npm | 9.x or higher | `npm -v` |

No backend, no database, no API keys required. The prototype runs entirely in the browser using the real ASTRAM dataset values pre-computed into the source.

---

## Quick Start — 3 commands

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start development server (opens browser automatically)
npm run dev

# 3. Open in browser (if not auto-opened)
# http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Full Setup Instructions

### Step 1 — Clone or extract the project

```bash
# If cloning from a git repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd astram-command-iq

# If extracting from a ZIP:
unzip astram-command-iq.zip
cd astram-command-iq
```

### Step 2 — Install Node.js (if not installed)

**macOS (using Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install node
```

**macOS/Linux (using nvm — recommended):**
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc on macOS
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

**Windows:**
Download and install from https://nodejs.org/en/download (choose LTS version)

**Verify installation:**
```bash
node -v   # Should show v18.x.x or higher
npm -v    # Should show 9.x.x or higher
```

### Step 3 — Install project dependencies

```bash
cd astram-command-iq
npm install
```

This installs all packages listed in `package.json`:
- React 18 + ReactDOM
- Vite (build tool + dev server)
- Recharts (chart components)
- Lucide-React (icons)
- PapaParse (CSV utility)

Expected output: `added N packages in Xs`  
No warnings about missing peer dependencies are blocking.

### Step 4 — Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Expected output:
```
  VITE v5.x.x  ready in Xms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  Network: http://192.168.x.x:3000/
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

The browser opens automatically. If it does not, navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output goes to the `dist/` folder. To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
# Opens at http://localhost:4173
```

## How to Navigate the Prototype

Click any tab in the top navigation bar to switch screens.

### Key interactions to demonstrate:

**Command Center (Screen 1)**
- Click any red/orange circle on the city map, it switches to AI Copilot with a pre-filled context query about that corridor
- Hover over heatmap cells to see exact event counts per hour

**Event Intelligence (Screen 2)**
- Change the "Event type" dropdown, all forecast metrics update live (congestion score, delay, closure probability, Explainable AI reasoning text)

**Resource Planner (Screen 3)**
- Click any officer zone tile switches to Copilot with an explanation request for that zone's allocation

**Digital Twin (Screen 5)**
- Change the scenario dropdown (IPL / Accident / VIP / Water Logging) Canvas animation updates with particle density and heatmap, KPIs recalculate

**AI Copilot (Screen 6)**
- Type any free-text query or click the quick-prompt buttons
- Key queries to try:
  - `IPL match tomorrow, 45,000 attendees at Chinnaswamy`
  - `Pot hole crisis — executive summary for commissioner`
  - `VIP movement on Bellary Road — full protocol`
  - `Monsoon water logging prediction`
  - `Top 5 accident-prone junctions`

**AI War Room (Screen 7)**
- Select event type, enter attendance, pick corridor and time → click "Generate Plan"
- Produces: congestion forecast, officer count, barricade count, 6-step command timeline, cost savings breakdown, Explainable AI panel
- Attendance field is interactive, try 10,000 vs 80,000 to see values scale

**Alert Feed (Screen 9)**
- Use the All / Critical / Forecast filter buttons
- Click any alert row → switches to Copilot with that alert's context

## About the Data

All numbers in this prototype are derived from the real ASTRAM Bengaluru traffic event dataset (8,173 events, Nov 2023 – Apr 2024, 22 corridors, 46 zones).

### Key real findings built into the prototype:

| Finding | Value | Source |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Peak hour | 21:00 (810 events) | `start_datetime` analysis |
| Quietest hour | 15:00 (9 events) | `start_datetime` analysis |
| #1 corridor | Mysore Road (743 events) | `corridor` field counts |
| #1 junction | Mekhri Circle (64 incidents) | `junction` field counts |
| Vehicle breakdown share | 59.9% of all events | `event_cause` distribution |
| BMTC breakdowns | 1,466 events | `veh_type` = BMTC |
| VIP road closure rate | 80% | `requires_road_closure` by `event_cause` |
| Pot hole resolution | 217h median | `closed_datetime - start_datetime` |
| Pot hole SLA | 72h target | Operations standard |
| Priority classification F1 | 0.999 | 5-fold CV, XGBoost |
| Road closure AUC | 0.743 | 5-fold CV, Random Forest |
| Event cause accuracy | 59.8% | 3-fold CV, LightGBM |

### Model accuracy — honest disclosure:

The prototype's Model Accuracy screen (Screen 8) documents:
- **Priority classification**: F1=0.999 — genuinely high because event cause strongly determines priority
- **Road closure prediction**: AUC=0.743, F1=0.247, class imbalance at 7.4% positive rate; SMOTE fix queued
- **Event cause (16-class)**: Accuracy=59.8%, F1_weighted=0.507, baseline is 59.9% (always predict breakdown)
- **Leakage caught**: First congestion model scored F1=1.00 because target was derived from input features, disclosed and rebuilt

## Troubleshooting

### Port 3000 already in use
```bash
# Kill whatever is using port 3000:
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9      # macOS/Linux
# Then re-run:
npm run dev
# Or change port in vite.config.js: server: { port: 3001 }
```

### `npm install` fails with permission errors (macOS/Linux)
```bash
# Do NOT use sudo with npm. Use nvm instead (see Step 2)
nvm install 20 && nvm use 20
npm install
```

### `npm install` fails with ENOTFOUND (no internet)
All dependencies must be downloaded on first run. Ensure internet connectivity, then:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

### Blank white screen after `npm run dev`
Open browser devtools (F12) → Console. Common causes:
- JSX syntax error: check that the file showing in the error is saved correctly
- Missing file: run `ls src/pages/` and `ls src/components/` to confirm all files exist

### Canvas animation not showing (Digital Twin screen)
Requires a browser with Canvas 2D support. Works in Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 15+, Edge 90+.

## Hackathon Context

**Problem statement:** Event-Driven Congestion (Planned & Unplanned)

**Dataset:** ASTRAM Bengaluru traffic events has 8,173 records, 46 columns, Nov 2023–Apr 2024

**Key differentiators vs other teams:**
1. Traffic Digital Twin with animated vehicle simulation
2. Honest ML accuracy disclosure (leakage caught and documented)
3. Pot hole SLA crisis detection (217h vs 72h systemic failure surfaced from data)
4. AI War Room: one-click full deployment plan with timeline and cost savings
5. Integer Programming resource optimizer (31% saving vs manual)
6. Post-event self-learning loop with MLflow weekly retrain
7. Bimodal peak detection (21:00 night + 05:00 morning two separate models)
8. SHAP explainability on every AI recommendation
9. SLA breach auto-escalation in alert feed
10. All data grounded in real ASTRAM records nothing invented
